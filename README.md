## Usage
This application is ran by entering the url of the repo. https://fit-to-go-bd9a2bfc1684.herokuapp.com/login

The user will want to either sign up for the application or login when they first get to our website and then from there they can choose from a multitude of exercises and choose to have them for a specific day. This will then populate a schedule from Monday-Sunday with those exercises.

## Technologies
Node.js, npm, javascript, css, handlebars, express.js, sequelize, mysql, heroku.

## Tests
Download the repo from github and then in Vs code, create an integrated terminal. After doing that, you can run the schema and switch to our database. Run the seed data and then the server.js file. Create routes for each function that the application can do and see if they all work.
